OpenPose is authored by [Gines Hidalgo](https://www.gineshidalgo.com/), [Zhe Cao](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/zhecao), [Tomas Simon](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tsimon/), [Shih-En Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sFQD3k4AAAAJ&hl=en), [Hanbyul Joo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hanbyulj/), and [Yaser Sheikh](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yaser/). Currently, it is being maintained by [Gines Hidalgo](https://www.gineshidalgo.com/) and [Bikramjot Hanzra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bikz05). The [original CVPR 2017 repo](https://github.com/ZheC/Multi-Person-Pose-Estimation) includes Matlab and Python versions, as well as the training code. The body pose estimation work is based on [the original ECCV 2016 demo](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/caffe_rtpose).

In addition, OpenPose would not be possible without the [CMU Panoptic Studio dataset](http://domedb.perception.cs.cmu.edu/).

We would also like to thank all the people who helped OpenPose in any way. The main contributors are listed in [doc/contributors.md](doc/contributors.md).
